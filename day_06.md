# Pangenomics and taxonomy

How do the MAGs compare in size and number of contigs to the full genome?

| Contigs Stats | Methano_Bin10 | Methano_Bin13 | Methano_Bin1 | Methano_Bin3 | Methano_Bin5 | Methano_Bin8 | Methano_Bin9 | Methano_Mflavescens |
| ---- | --- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---- | --- |
| L50 |	93 | 27	| 89| 38	| 111	| 29 |	64 |	1 |

Genomes of Bin10, Bin9 and Bin8 are the "best" ones because they have relatively big genome sizes, smaller numer of contigs and longer average contig lenth.
